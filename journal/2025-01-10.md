# 2025-01-10

## Daily Stand-up

**Attendees:** Alice Nguyen, Ben Carter, Clara Diaz, Diana Evans, Ethan Foster, Fiona Green, Grace Harris, Henry Irving

**Alice:** Met with stakeholders about the timeline changes yesterday. Today I'll be updating the sprint planning based on their feedback. No blockers.

**Ben:** Started the SAP integration work and implemented the Redis caching POC yesterday. Today I'll continue with the ESB error handling improvements. Finally got SAP test environment access.

**Clara:** Completed the mood selection screen with animations yesterday. Today I'll work on the recipe display interface. No blockers.

**Diana:** Implemented test cases for the facial recognition edge cases yesterday. Today I'll run comprehensive testing on the combined mood detection system. No blockers.

**Ethan:** Finalized the firmware update for the brewing mechanism yesterday. Today I'll start researching edge computing options with Grace. Arduino components arrived.

**Fiona:** Completed the user preference screen backend connection yesterday. Today I'll work on the coffee history visualization feature. No blockers.

**Grace:** Integrated the voice and facial recognition systems yesterday. Today I'll continue research on edge computing options with Ethan. No blockers.

**Henry:** Completed the monitoring dashboard setup yesterday. Today I'll implement automated scaling for the cloud infrastructure. Blocker: Need budget approval for additional cloud resources.

## Incident Resolution Meeting

**Incident:** Production environment ESB failure (continued)

**Attendees:** Ben Carter, Diana Evans, Ethan Foster, Henry Irving

**Progress Update:**
- Ben completed the error handling implementation and initial testing shows promising results
- Henry reconfigured the monitoring alerts and verified they trigger appropriately in staging
- Diana completed the comprehensive test suite and identified additional edge cases
- Ethan designed a local caching mechanism that can store up to 50 transactions during outages

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy the error handling changes to production after hours tonight
- Implement the local caching mechanism in the next firmware update
- Update the incident response playbook with lessons learned
- Final review meeting scheduled for Monday to close the incident

## My Todos
- [x] Prepare budget justification for Henry's cloud resources request
- [ ] Review incident response playbook and update with recent learnings
- [x] Schedule after-hours support for tonight's production deployment
- [ ] Create recognition plan for team members who helped resolve the ESB incident
- [x] Set up mentoring pairs between senior and junior team members
- [ ] Plan technical lunch-and-learn session on Redis caching implementation
