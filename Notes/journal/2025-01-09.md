# 2025-01-09

## Daily Stand-up

**Attendees:** Alice Nguyen, Ben Carter, Clara Diaz, Diana Evans, Ethan Foster, Fiona Green, Grace Harris, Henry Irving

**Alice:** Revised the product launch timeline yesterday based on our sync meeting. Today I'll be meeting with key stakeholders to discuss the changes. Blocker: Need final confirmation on component delivery dates from Maya.

**Ben:** Implemented the initial error handling for the ESB yesterday. Today I'll work on the SAP integration and start the Redis caching proof of concept. Still waiting on SAP test environment access.

**Clara:** Started implementing the frontend components for the mood selection screen yesterday. Today I'll continue with this and add the animations. No blockers.

**Diana:** Documented the facial recognition edge cases and discussed solutions with Grace yesterday. Today I'll implement the test cases for these scenarios. No blockers.

**Ethan:** Made progress on the brewing mechanism response time yesterday. Today I'll finalize the firmware update. Still waiting for Arduino components.

**Fiona:** Got the API documentation from Ben and started the integration yesterday. Today I'll complete the user preference screen backend connection. No blockers.

**Grace:** Optimized the voice analysis model yesterday, achieving 8% better accuracy. Today I'll work on integrating it with the facial recognition system for combined mood detection. No blockers.

**Henry:** Implemented automated testing for deployment yesterday. Today I'll work on the monitoring dashboard for the production environment. No blockers.

## Technical Brainstorming Session

**Attendees:** Ben Carter, Ethan Foster, Grace Harris, Isabella Johnson, James Keller

**Topic:** Improving System Resilience and Scalability

**Key Discussion Points:**
- Current architecture limitations when scaling beyond 1000 concurrent users
- Options for implementing a more robust caching layer
- Potential for edge computing to reduce latency in mood detection
- Containerization strategy for easier deployment and scaling

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Implement Redis cache for user preferences and frequently accessed data
2. Move facial and voice analysis processing to edge devices to reduce cloud dependency
3. Adopt Kubernetes for container orchestration across environments
4. Create a circuit breaker pattern for all external system integrations
5. Develop a progressive degradation strategy for offline operation

**Next Steps:**
- Ben to create a proof of concept for the Redis caching layer
- Grace to research edge computing options for the mood detection algorithms
- Ethan to evaluate firmware updates required for edge processing
- James to approve resources for the Kubernetes implementation
- Isabella to prioritize these initiatives within the technical roadmap
