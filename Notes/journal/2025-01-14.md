## Incident Resolution Meeting

**Incident:** Data privacy breach in customer preference storage

**Attendees:** Ben Carter, Diana Evans, Henry Irving, James Keller

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Unencrypted customer preference data stored in development environment
- Development database accidentally exposed through misconfigured firewall
- No data masking implemented for sensitive information

**Impact:**
- Potential exposure of preference data for approximately 500 customers
- No financial or authentication data compromised
- Regulatory compliance concerns under GDPR and CCPA

**Resolution Actions (In Progress):**
- Immediately secured the exposed database
- Implementing encryption for all customer data
- Conducting full security audit of all environments
- Preparing notification for affected customers

**Next Steps:**
- Complete encryption implementation by end of day tomorrow
- Finalize security audit by Wednesday
- Review notification draft with legal team
- Schedule follow-up meeting in two days
