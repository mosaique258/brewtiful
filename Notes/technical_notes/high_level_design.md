*   **Purpose:** Stores and manages customer profiles, purchase history, preferences, and loyalty program information.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Platform:** Salesforce
    *   **Data Storage:** Structured customer data (personal info, purchase history, preferences).
    *   **API:** APIs for retrieving and updating customer data.
    *   **Loyalty Program:** Manages loyalty points and discounts.
*   **API Calls (CRM):**
    *   `GetCustomerProfile(customerId)`: Retrieves a customer profile based on their ID.
    *   `UpdateCustomerPreferences(customerId, preferences)`: Updates a customer's preferences.
    *   `ApplyLoyaltyDiscount(customerId, orderTotal)`: Applies a loyalty discount to an order.
    *   `CreateCustomerProfile(profileData)`: Creates a new customer profile.

### 3.4 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System

*   **Purpose:** Manages inventory, supply chain, and procurement for coffee beans, milk, sugar, and other supplies.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Platform:** SAP
    *   **Data Storage:** Structured customer data (personal info, purchase history, preferences).
    *   **Inventory Management:** Real-time tracking of inventory levels.
    *   **Supply Chain Management:** Manages the supply chain.
    *   **Procurement:** Automates the purchase order process.
*   **API Calls (ERP):**
    *   `CheckInventoryLevel(ingredientId)`: Checks the current inventory level of an ingredient.
    *   `CreatePurchaseOrder(ingredientId, quantity)`: Creates a purchase order for an ingredient.
    *   `UpdateInventoryLevel(ingredientId, quantity)`: Updates the inventory level of an ingredient.

### 3.5 Voice Analysis System

*   **Purpose:** Analyzes the user's voice for emotional tone and motivation levels.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Technology:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
    *   **Algorithms:** Machine learning for emotion and stress level detection.
    *   **Output:** Mood (happy, sad, angry) and motivation score.
*   **API Calls (Voice Analysis):**
    *   `AnalyzeVoice(audioData)`: Analyzes audio data and returns a mood score.

### 3.6 Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection System

*   **Purpose:** Identifies facial expressions and maps them to emotional states.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Technology:** OpenCV
    *   **Algorithms:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for facial feature and emotion classification.
    *   **Output:** Emotional state (happy, sad, angry) score.
*   **API Calls (Facial Analysis):**
    *   `AnalyzeFace(imageData)`: Analyzes image data and returns a mood score.

### 3.7 Coffee Recipe Management System

*   **Purpose:** Maps emotional states to specific coffee recipes.
*   **Technical Details:**

    *   The Smart Coffee Machine calls `AnalyzeFace(imageData)` on the Facial Recognition System and `AnalyzeVoice(audioData)` on the Voice Analysis System.
3.  **CRM Integration:**
    *   The Smart Coffee Machine calls `GetCustomerProfile(customerId)` on the CRM (via the ESB).  The ESB transforms the request and routes it to the CRM.
4.  **Recipe Selection:**
    *   The Smart Coffee Machine calls `GetRecipe(mood, preferences)` on the Coffee Recipe Management System.
5.  **Inventory Check:**
    *   The Smart Coffee Machine calls `CheckInventoryLevel(ingredientId)` on the ERP (via the ESB) to check ingredient availability.
6.  **Brewing Process:**
    *   The Smart Coffee Machine calls `StartBrewing(recipe)` to initiate the brewing process.
    *   The Smart Coffee Machine controls the Brewing Mechanism and Dispensing System using internal actuator controls.
7.  **Feedback:**
    *   The Smart Coffee Machine may update the customerâ€™s preferences by calling `UpdateCustomerPreferences(customerId, preferences)` on the CRM (via the ESB).
8.  **ERP Updates:**
    *   After brewing, the Smart Coffee Machine calls `UpdateInventoryLevel(ingredientId, quantity)` on the ERP (via the ESB) to update inventory levels.
