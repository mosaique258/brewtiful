# Backlog Ideas Brainstorming


## Optimizations

These optimizations focus on improving the performance and speed of the system for a faster and more responsive user experience.

1.  **[Caching Frequently Used Profiles - Enhanced](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Implement a robust caching mechanism for frequently used customer profiles locally on the coffee machine to minimize latency. Utilize cache invalidation strategies, size limits, versioning, and pre-loading for optimal performance.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Significantly reduces latency for regular customers.

2.  **[Predictive Ingredient Pre-Heating - Enhanced](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Proactively pre-heat water and warm milk based on advanced demand prediction models considering time, day, and external factors. Implement adaptive pre-heating levels and ingredient level monitoring for efficiency.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Minimizes brewing time, especially during peak demand.

3.  **[Optimized API Call Orchestration - Enhanced](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Refactor API calls for parallel execution and implement resilience mechanisms like circuit breakers and retry mechanisms for a stable and responsive system. Explore API aggregation where possible.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Reduces overall response time and improves system stability.

4.  **[Efficient Mood Analysis Algorithm](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Optimize the mood analysis algorithms (voice and facial impression) for faster processing without sacrificing accuracy. Explore lightweight models or hardware acceleration if applicable.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Speeds up the entire personalization process.

5.  **[Streamlined Recipe Selection Process](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Optimize the recipe selection logic to quickly identify the most suitable coffee blend based on mood and user preferences. Consider pre-calculating or indexing recipes for faster lookups.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Reduces processing time for personalized drink creation.

### New Functionalities 

These functionalities broaden the system's offerings and enhance personalization beyond the core coffee experience.

1.  **[Tea and Herbal Infusions Support - Enhanced](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Expand the system to brew teas and herbal infusions, with recipe management, dedicated dispensing if needed, and precise temperature control.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Broadens market appeal to tea drinkers.

2.  **[Customizable Flavor Shots - Enhanced](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Offer a range of flavor shots with intensity control, natural/artificial options, and sugar-free alternatives. Allow for flavor shot combinations and recipe creation.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Provides richer drink personalization.

3.  **[Smart Snack Pairing Suggestions - Enhanced](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Suggest snacks based on beverage and mood, integrating with local providers, considering dietary filters, and offering diverse snack categories.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Creates a holistic and engaging experience.

4.  **[Beverage Customization Presets](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Allow users to save and name their favorite beverage customizations (including blends, flavor shots, etc.) as presets for quick re-ordering in the future.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Enhances user convenience and speeds up ordering for repeat preferences.

5.  **[Mood-Based Music Integration (Optional)](pplx://action/followup)**:
    *   Explore optional integration with music streaming services. Based on the analyzed mood, suggest or play music that complements the beverage and mood.
    *   **[Benefit](pplx://action/followup)**: Further enhances the "mood ecosystem" and creates a more immersive experience.

## Increased Digitalization 

This section distinguishes between mobile apps for enterprise users (maintainers) and consumer customers (end users).
