### Assumptions
 * Reach: Estimated based on potential user base. Enterprise features are based on machine/business count.
 * Impact:  Scale 1-3 represents:
   * 3:  Very High Impact - Core UX improvement, significant revenue potential, critical efficiency gain, major user delight.
   * 2.5: High Impact -  Strong UX improvement, good revenue potential, valuable efficiency gain, strong user delight.
   * 2: Medium Impact - Noticeable UX improvement, moderate revenue potential, moderate efficiency gain, noticeable user delight.
   * 1.5: Medium-Low Impact -  Minor UX improvement, some revenue potential, minor efficiency gain, some user delight, but mainly convenience or incremental improvement.
   * 1: Low Impact -  Minimal UX improvement, low revenue potential, limited efficiency gain, very minor user delight, primarily a "nice to have".
 * Confidence:  Percentage reflecting certainty in Reach and Impact estimations. Higher confidence for core functionalities, lower for newer or less validated ideas.
 * Effort:  Estimated in person-months, relative to each other within this backlog.  "1" person-month is a baseline, more complex features are assigned higher effort.
